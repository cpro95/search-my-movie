Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans and advances in genetics, Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a genetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. He and Silver pitched the concept to Fox as a way to reboot the Apes franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest. In 2010, producers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark of Chernin Entertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver as writers. Rise was followed the sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014 and Dawn was followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in 2017.

Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans and advances in genetics, Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a genetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. He and Silver pitched the concept to Fox as a way to reboot the Apes franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest. In 2010, producers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark of Chernin Entertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver as writers. Rise was followed the sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014 and Dawn was followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in 2017. In October 2016, it was reported that a fourth Planet of the Apes film was being discussed.","strFileName":"Rise.of.the.Planet.of.the.Apes.2011.1080p.BluRay.H264.AAC-RARBG.mp4","strPath":"E:\\E-Movies\\Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\","playCount":null,"lastPlayed":null,"dateAdded":"2015-01-04 07:42:22","resumeTimeInSeconds":null,"totalTimeInSeconds":null,"rating":7.2,"votes":6029,"rating_type":"themoviedb","uniqueid_value":"tt1318514","uniqueid_type":"imdb"},{"idMovie":355,"idFile":356,"c00":"RoboCop","c01":"In RoboCop, the year is 2028 and multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology.

He and Silver pitched the concept to Fox as a way to reboot the Apes franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee Caesar, the lead character of Conquest. In 2010, producers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark of Chernin Entertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver as writers. Rise was followed the sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes in 2014 and Dawn was followed by War for the Planet of the Apes in 2017.
